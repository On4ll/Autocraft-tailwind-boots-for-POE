# Autocraft-tailwind-boots-for-POE

A simple autohotkey script to detect the ever elusive "Tailwind" mod on boots when crafting using orb of alterations in Path of Exile.
To use it, just run the scrip, right click on orb of alterations, then hover the mouse pointer over a hunter influenced magic boots and press the "]" key. Done, now just wait for the mod to roll and the script will automatically stop. Profit ! :D
